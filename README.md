When you finish this, you will have finished the last task of this course! 

You will use the functions you'd implemented in the previous task to build a deep network, and apply it to cat vs non-cat classification. Hopefully, you will see an improvement in accuracy relative to your previous logistic regression implementation.  

**After this task you will be able to:**
- Build and apply a deep neural network to supervised learning.
